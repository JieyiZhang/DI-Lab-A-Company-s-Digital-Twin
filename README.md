Celonis Process Mining reconstructs and visualizes processes as they really happened based on the traces left in IT systems. Utilizing the actual representation of a company’s business process, analysts can quickly find out where inefficiencies and bottlenecks occurred in the past. To find the best improvement strategy, a digital twin model should be implemented based on the existing process mining log. Such model will be able to answer a wide variety of what-if questions and simulate the effects of possible improvement measures ultimately facilitating a manager’s decision making in the area of business process improvement.
